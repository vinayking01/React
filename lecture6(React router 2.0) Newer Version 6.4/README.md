### Nested Routes in React Router

### Not found route
1.  ## Syntax - 
    ```
    <Route path='*' element={<h3>Page Not Found</h3>}>
    ```

### Dynamic Routing


## Important Point - 
1. The Outlet component in React Router is used for nested routing. It serves as a placeholder for child routes to be rendered. When you define nested routes, the Outlet component renders the matched child route's component within the parent component. This is useful for creating layouts with nested views, such as dashboards with sub-sections.
